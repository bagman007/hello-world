My Hello World at Github

I am getting back into coding professionally after leaving the industry in 2005.
Its been a minute.  Back into the fire. Very eclectic life.  Professional Muscical Theater, 
Small Business Owner, and Software Engineer over the course of the last 20 years.
Lots of Ideas. Much to learn about what is available in today's marketplace.
